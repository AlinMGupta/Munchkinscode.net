        <h2>Strings</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Integers</h2>
        <p>
          An Integer is a type of variable that holds whole numbers. Integers can't be decimals (as you may have learned in your math class).
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Floats and Doubles</h2>
        <p>
          Floats and Doubles are basicaly the same thing, they are variables that store numbers. The only diffirence between floats/doubles and Integers
          is the fact that they can contain decimals.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>
          A list is exactly what it sounds like it is a list of variables that fit under 1 main variable. A list can not contain multiple diffirent
          types of variables.
