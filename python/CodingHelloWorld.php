        <h2>Print</h2>
        <p>
          When printing something in Python there are three things you need to make sure you have. You start by just typing print. After the print you add perenthisis,
          the perinthisis hold the peramiters. Inside the perinthisis you could do somehthing as simple as write "Hello World" in quotes. Or as we will discuss in later content,
          you could use a combination of user input and variables.
