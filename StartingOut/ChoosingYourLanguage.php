        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
          Python is the language that we would recomend for people who have only done block coding, or even never done any kind of coding before. Python is also a language that is very versitile
          can be used for a lot of types of projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>
          Javascript is definitely a more advanced language and is not very easy to pick up, we would not reccomend this language for beginners.
          <br />
          Javascript is a unique language in the fact that it is typicaly used in unison with html, though it can be used by itself if you install node.js.
        </p>

        <h2>html</h2>
        <p>
          html is a very basic language but it can really only be used for creating websites. This is a good language for learing the basic fundamentals but is also very one dimensional.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>C#</h2>
        <p>
          C# is a development language mostly used for how fast it is, even though this language sounds good at first it is very complicated. We would not reccomend starting with this language.
